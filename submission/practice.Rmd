***Scaling up.*** The advantage of the dual index approach is that a
large number of samples can be sequenced using a number of primers equal
to only twice the square root of the number of samples. To fully
evaluate this approach, we re-sequenced the V4 region of 360 samples
that were previously described by sequencing the distal end of the V35
region on the 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform ([18](#_ENREF_18)). In that
study we observed a clear separation between murine fecal samples
obtained from 8 C57BL/6 mice at 0 to 9 (“early”) and 141 to 150 (“late”)
days after weaning and there was significantly less variation between
the late samples compared to the early samples. In addition to the mouse
fecal samples, we allocated 2 pairs of indices to re-sequence our mock
community. We generated 4.3 million pairs of sequence reads from the 16S
rRNA gene with an average coverage of `r round(mean(nseqs), 0)` pairs
of reads per sample (95% of the samples had more than
`r round(quantile(nseqs, 0.05), 0)` pairs of sequences) using a new
collection of 8-nt indices (Supplemental Materials). Although individual
samples were expected to have varying amplification efficiencies, analysis
of the number of reads per index did not suggest a systematic positive or
negative amplification biases that could be attributed to the indices. The
combined error rate for the two mock communities was 0.07% before
pre-clustering and `r format(pc_error_rate, nsmall=2)`% after
(n=`r pc_error_nseqs` sequences). When we used UCHIME to remove chimeras
and rarefied to 5,000 sequences there were an average of
`r format(n_otus, nsmall=1)` OTUs (i.e.
`r format(n_otus-perfect, nsmall=1)` spurious OTUs). Similar to our
previous results, ordination of the mouse fecal samples again showed the
separation between the early and late periods and increased stabilization
with age (Figure 4; Mantel Test Coefficient=
`r format(round(m.test$statistic, digits=2), nsmall=2)`,
p\<`r format(round(m.test$signif, digits=3), nsmall=3)`**). These results
clearly indicate that our approach can be scaled to multiplex large numbers
of samples.
